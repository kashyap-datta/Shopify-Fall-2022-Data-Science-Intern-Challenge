Question 1 Solutions

a) We can observe that order_amount is highly skewed, with min as 90, max as 704000 and standard deviation of 41282.54. The exorbitant pricing of the sneakers at shop 78 and bulk purchasing from shop 42 has skewed the mean.The presence of outliers is effecting the value of the mean which is being considered naively as the Average Order Value. 

b) As mean fails to represent the average order value, I am considering median as a metric to represent average order value as median is robust against outliers.

c) The median order value is 284.0 dollars
